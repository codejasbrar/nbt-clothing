Like you, most riders searching for the perfect riding pants give up and decide their everyday jeans are the answer.  Why? Because riding pants have bulky padding, uncomfortable material, overpriced, and just look bad.\nWe used to say the same thing until we got burned, literally. Like over 20,000 riders each year, we experienced road rash.\n\nSo, we set out to create protective motorcycle pants so stylish, comfortable, and versatile you’ll never want to take them off.","tab_title_2":"features","tab_content_2":"<p>Our premium 11-ounce denim is blended with polyester to keep you cool and 3% spandex to add flex in all the right places. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Road Rash Resistant<\/li>\n<li>CE approved Removable knee &amp; hip protectors included<\/li>\n<li>Slim straight fit<\/li>\n<li>Elastic accordion panels on knees &amp; lower back<\/li>\n<li>Cargo Flap Pockets<\/li> \n<li>Light Herringbone pattern<\/li>\n<li>YKK® Zipper<\/li>\n<li>70% Cotton, 28% Polyester, 2% Spandex<\/li>\n<\/ul>","tab_title_3":"Sizing","tab_content_3":"<p><em><span><strong>WE RECOMMEND SIZING DOWN FROM YOUR REGULAR PANT SIZE!<\/strong><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Please measure your favorite jeans at home and compare it to the size chart below before placing your order.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Our model in all pictures above is 5'11\" 180lbs and wears a size 30<\/em><\/p>\n\n<table height=\"182\" width=\"551\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" data-mce-selected=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 78.515625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">SIZE<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.484375px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">WAIST<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 135.71875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">INSEAM<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 99.65625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">HIP<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.671875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">THIGH<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 78.515625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">28<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.484375px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">30.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 135.71875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">33.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 99.65625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">38.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.671875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">20.50<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 78.515625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">30<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.484375px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">32.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 135.71875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">34.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 99.65625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">39.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.671875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">21.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 78.515625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">32<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.484375px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">34.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 135.71875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">34.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 99.65625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">40.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.671875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">22.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 78.515625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">34<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.484375px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">36.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 135.71875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">34.50<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 99.65625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">41.50<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.671875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">23.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 78.515625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">36<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.484375px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">38.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 135.71875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">34.50<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 99.65625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">43.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.671875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">23.50<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 78.515625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">38<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.484375px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">40.00<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 135.71875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">34.50<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 99.65625px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">44.50<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 112.671875px;\" class=\"text-align-center\">24.50<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Please note other than SIZE chart is in INCHES.<\/p>","tab_title_4":"Care","tab_content_4":"<ul>\n<li>Machine washable.<\/li> \n<li>Remove pads before washing.<\/li> \n<li>Wash with cold water.<\/li> \n<li>No bleach.<\/li> \n<li>Hang to dry.<\/li> \n<li>Warm iron is OK. <\/li>\n<\/ul>","tab_title_5":"Free shipping & returns\/exchanges","tab_content_5":"All purchases come with a 30-day satisfaction guarantee and free ground shipping for all orders over $100.

The SPANDEX ratio has to be perfectly dialed in, not too stretchy or firm. This may seem like a simple “split the difference” situation, but it isn't.
